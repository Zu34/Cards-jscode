# Simplified Breakdown of Function Types that is being used in this simply task for me :

## The ```displayProducts``` ***function*** creates HTML elements and fills them with product data using ```innerHTML```.

## *** Arrow Functions: ***
Short and simple syntax, e.g., ```products.forEach(product => { ... })```.

## *** Callback Functions: ***
```showProductDetails``` is a callback that runs when a card is clicked.

## *** Higher-order Functions: ***
```forEach``` iterates over the products array, a classic example of functional programming.

## *** DOM Manipulation: *** 
Methods like createElement, appendChild, and innerHTML are used to build the UI dynamically.
